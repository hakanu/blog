title: Fix scaling issue of Counter Strike in Ubuntu (Steam)
---
My CS:GO doesn't fit in neither of my monitors (1080p and 4k). Even running in full screen mode didn't change anything.

Go to library
1. Right click on Counter Strike: Global Offensive
1. Hit properties
1. Come to command line options, put this: `-full -width 1920`

1. Run the game again, enjoy.
