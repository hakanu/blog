* For people who uses npm for left-pad which was unpublished by Azer, can do this for fixing the builds: (Because code is still in github; just not in npm anymore)
```
"dependencies": {
    "left-pad": "git+ssh://git@github.com:azer/left-pad"
}
```
OR shortcut:
```
"dependencies": {
  "left-pad": "azer/left-pad"
}
```
