I like prose.io because you can work on the blog post before publishing it. Since I have moved my blog to Netlify CMS, I'm forcing myself to write everything in this CMS. However, this draft/published mechanic doesn't come out of box (well it sort of does).

According to [netlify docs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options/), add this to your config.yml under /admin folder:
`publish_mode: editorial_workflow`

This is only supported by Github currently. However, they will add more platforms soon.

Once you add it, it automatically adds a dropdown to your post to save it as draft. You can publish it later.

And in the /admin home page you will have a link called "Workflows" at the navbar which leads to a nice kanban style board with posts draft/in review/published:
