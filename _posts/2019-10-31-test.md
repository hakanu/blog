According to [netlify docs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options/), add this to your config.yml under /admin folder:
`publish_mode: editorial_workflow`

This is only supported by Github currently. However, they will add more platforms soon.

Once you add it, it automatically adds a dropdown to your post to save it as draft. You can publish it later.
