I bought a small package of happiness from amazon.
Little, fast, silent, light, beautiful...

It's an SSD, [Samsung 840 EVO](http://ssd.userbenchmark.com/Samsung-840-Evo-250GB/Rating/1594) which has really aggressive pricing.

I used this site to decide what to buy:

You should not really care about this 6gb/s thingy. You should divide it by 8 (1 byte=8 bits and it's 6gbit not 6gbyte); so this is the speed of your sata3. Old sata2 ones have around 3gb/s. 
6gb/s ~= 750mb/s

# Fun part: Benchmarks

My old companion who is still awesome! (1tb, 7200 RPM)
** Just a side note, this hdd is connected to computer via a USB3.0 box, tests are not done by connecting it to the mainboard.
