I faced a problem like this and when i searched it on the web, i saw that a lot of people have same issue. So I wanna tell the solution of this:

- Enter the folder that the game is installed. For example, mine is like this: “<strong>D:\Program Files\Electronic Arts\Need for Speed SHIFT</strong>“

- Open "<strong>Movies</strong>" directory which is in here.

- Find the file named “<strong>Career_Intro.bik</strong>”  and rename it as if “<strong>Career_Intro_.bik</strong>”.

- The intro video will not be shown and you can directly start the career.
