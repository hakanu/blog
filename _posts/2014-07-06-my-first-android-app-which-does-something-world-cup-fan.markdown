When the world cup first started, I knew that I won't be able to watch all of the games and I was going to look for highlight videos and goals after the games desperately on youtube, dailymotion, google etc. So I created this [simple android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=haku.io.wc_goals) which collects the match video links from the sites like rutube and plays within the app.

Although I was not expecting much download, after one month of the launch, I received:

* 2,664 unique users
* 53,576 screen views
* 73% returning users
* 01:40 avg session duration
* Downloaded from 120 different countries/territories

Interesting point is that there is no advertisement or branding for it. They are all organic downloads.


There are also additional information like:

* Fixtures
* Groups
* Football club information
* Player database

It's updated pretty quickly. After 1-2 hours of the each game's final whistle, you can see that game and its highlights in the home tab.

I know you are saying that this app is going to die in 2-3 weeks. However, I also show the highlights of the games which are not from world cup. So people will be able to use it for champions league, UEFA cup, bundes liga, premier league, la liga... etc. Maybe I should change the name of the app at the end of the world cup.

Here is the application, feel free to download and evaluate:
