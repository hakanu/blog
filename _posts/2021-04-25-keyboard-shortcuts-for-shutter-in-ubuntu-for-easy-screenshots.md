title: Keyboard shortcuts for shutter in Ubuntu for easy screenshots
---
Shutter is my favorite screenshot taking tool in Ubuntu. However, it doesn't give keyboard shortcuts in its own preferences. We should leverage Ubuntu's very own global keyboard shortcuts.

1. Go to Settings -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Scroll very bottom
1. Hit + sign
1. Enter a name, eg. `shutter`
1. Enter the command:
	1. `shutter -s` for selection based partial screenshot
	1. `shutter -f` for full screen screenshots. I use previous one.
1. Hit add.
1. Try it!
