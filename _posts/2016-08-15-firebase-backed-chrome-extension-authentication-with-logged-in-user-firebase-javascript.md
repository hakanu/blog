  Firebase backed Chrome Extension authentication with logged in user #firebase
  #javascript
---
I have been pretty busy with understanding how Firebase and Chrome Extensions get on well.
Took me some time to simply get the Chrome's logged in user's information through an extension and pushing that info to Firebase. The latter is easy, I have done plenty of projects in the past with Firebase JS API. However, first part has always been a pain for me. OAuth is not my strongest suit.

I started simple, found this:
[Firebase Auth w/ Google Sign-In in Chrome Extensions](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-js/tree/master/auth/chromextension)

However this doc is missing a couple of steps. If you are an ignorant like me, welcome, otherwise you can stop reading.
