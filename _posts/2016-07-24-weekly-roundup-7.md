There was a coup attempt in Turkey so I skipped writing new posts. Here I go again.

* Openshift is incredibly easy to set up ghost and wordpress for free.
  * Free tier's response times are amazing, you can even uploada images.
  * I really like ghost, I'd definitely go back if I didn't move my blog to gh-pages.
* Namecheap has added catch-all filter for incoming emails. So no need to use mailgun filters any more.
* Started to play Overwatch :/
