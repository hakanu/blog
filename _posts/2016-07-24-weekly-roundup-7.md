There was a coup attempt in Turkey so I skipped writing new posts. Here I go again.

* Openshift is incredibly easy to set up ghost and wordpress for free.
  * Free tier's response times are amazing, you can even uploada images.
  * I really like ghost, I'd definitely go back if I didn't move my blog to gh-pages.
* Namecheap has added catch-all filter for incoming emails. So no need to use mailgun filters any more.
* Started to play Overwatch :/

* Successfully migrated one of my apps from Parse.com to my self-hosted parse server in heroku free tier which is backed by MongoLab (mLab). So it's still free but of course not as performant as before. MLab puts some latency and heroku free tier apps sleep 6 hours per day. Let's how it will go. However, this was a tricky process. May write something about it later.
