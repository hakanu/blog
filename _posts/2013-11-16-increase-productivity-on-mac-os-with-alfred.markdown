I'm already productive on Mac OS :P If you are big fan of spotlight and <a href="http://www2.think-less-do-more.com/avafind/">ava find</a>, alfred is just for you. I like using keyboard and my shortcuts. Alfred embraces this usability with snappy and sleek UI to increase productivity on Mac OS.

It works similar to spotlight but it's highly customisable. You can change the UI colors, indexing features, results structure etc. In addition to these nice features it also provides quick web search options plus giving you chance to create your custom searches which is the coolest feature in my opinion.

Here is the best part, Alfred is a free application for Mac OS, you can get powerpack for 17.
