I finally got my OnePlus One after a long waiting for an invitation. I have been using it for 2 weeks.

# Pros
* Price price price. it's a giant phablet.
* Gorgeous design. people are asking me all the time what phone this is. 
* I started to like back cover. some people might not like it though. I don't know, I fell on it from my bike and it survived with just some scratches in the back.  Anyway, the back cover is replaceable, yet another +1. 
* Camera is waaaay better than n5. It has slow mo and 4k UHD and DCI support. DCI is not supported by all 4k recorders. 
* Cyanogenmod is awesomely awesome. They have great support. since this guy is their flagship, they are really solving problems with OTA updates. We have 2 year support from CM. 
* Battery yes! finally. this is where I was bought in. my n5 was sufficient for everything but it's battery was so unstable. I know it's not gonna last long but it's impossible to anticipate it.  with opo you don't have those things. I saw almost 5 hours screen on time. it's powered by 3100mah battery. 
* charger from the box is great as well. It charges really fast. it's a 5V 2.1mA adapter.  My old ZTE was charged in less than 7 minutes. 
* packaging was so good! 
* screen is crisp. I forgive its not being qhd. 
* shipping was so fast. I chose express and it  arrived in 6 days.
* front camera is 5mp, but first lemme take a selfie
* CM camera app is awesome, it has a lot of  modes. 
* CM is very good at combining strong sides of pure Android with useful customizing capabilities. you can change almost all behaviours of the phone. 
* Gestures are so easy to activate to I don't really use them but lock and unlock gestures are extremely useful. I barely use the power button. 
* 3gb RAM - more ram FTW!
* East to modify cpu governor,  performance settings and memory management settings without rooting your phone.  just enable developer mode. 
* Easy to activate power save mode after 14% of battery level for example. it's Android L style power saving (reduce the CPU frequency). No rooting required.
* Capacitive vs on screen button switch. be able to assign custom behaviours to the capacitive buttons. 
* Music shortcuts like next/prev song. this has been a long missing feature from me since Sony Ericsson Walkman phone times.
* I stopped using my tablet and iPod touch. One device will rule them all.
* Dropped twice. Only minor scratches in the back cover which is changeable.

# Cons
* Sooo big. Bigger than g3 and s5 even though it has same 5.5 screen size. 
* Prices differ in different countries. be careful which country you are buying from. You can switch by typing country code at the address bar.
* I don't really care but battery is not changeable. 
* After getting used to this guy, other phones look like little toys.
* This is a rare problem but I have a slight issue with the touch screen. When I type fast, phone thinks I'm swiping, pretty annoying. According to the changelogs, they have already fixed this issue. However, mine has not been fixed after updates. Waiting for another one.

# Some Stats
## Before ART
FYI: I hate benchmark tests, they all mislead people.

## After ART
Don't think it's impacted much by ART

For a Nexus 5 user like me, these are impressive numbers. Because max I can see 3 hours Screen On Time (SOT) with my N5.

# Accessories
I bought [this guy](http://www.ebay.ie/itm/261557174193?ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1423.l2649) for screen protection but never installed.
Instead, I use these [simple ones](http://www.ebay.ie/itm/360987832726?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649).
I don't like cases, especially when the phone is already big. However, I bought [this bumper](http://www.ebay.ie/itm/221498920491?var=520355286112&ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649) just in case.
