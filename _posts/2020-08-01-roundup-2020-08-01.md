Has been more than 8mo since I last posted.

- [Reading] Are you a bad decision maker? https://blog.usejournal.com/are-you-a-bad-decision-maker-34690deae223
		- Would you change your good decision with a bad decision if you knew the outcome of the decision?

- Python snippet to enable logging to terminal (better than using print): 

```python
logging.getLogger().setLoggingLevel()
```

- Tools discovered
	- [visidata](https://www.visidata.org/): This is a sick tool to view/edit/search tabular data. Way better than libreoffice, vim, xsv etc. I tried all of them, none was coming closer to vd. I like dealing with CSV files sizing around GB magnitude. visidata is great at dealing with them, opening lazily and searching and it doubles with vim style jumping around.
		- `pip install visidata` or `sudo apt-get install visidata`
		- `vd my.csv` => Enjoy.
	- [timescaledb](https://www.timescale.com/): Set up on top of Postgres and specialized for timeseries storing. Direct competitor is [influxdb](https://www.influxdata.com/)
		- [Comparison benchmark: TimescaleDB vs. InfluxDB: Purpose built differently for time-series data](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/timescaledb-vs-influxdb-for-time-series-data-timescale-influx-sql-nosql-36489299877/)
		- Personal opinion: influx is pretty easy setup and feels like mongodb in terms of ease of use. However, it doesn't use complete SQL unlike timescaledb. So for really large datasets, I'd say go for timescaledb given that it's powered by postgres which is my all time favorite database.
	- [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa): Really nice ls replacement.
		- `cargo install exa`
		- `brew install exa`
- TIL
	- Tesco has 3400 stores in UK, 6500 stores worldwide.
	- Postgres by default uses a unix user account to authorize. In order to connect from a program, you need to convert authorization to `md5` from `peer` in `pg_hba.conf`.

- Free stuff for developers (web or backend)
	- In case you didn't GCP has always free micro instance unlike AWS' 1 year free micro instance: https://cloud.google.com/free
	- Hyvor talk is a good free alternative to disqus which started to show extreme number of ads in my websites so i'm moving away from disqus: https://talk.hyvor.com/
